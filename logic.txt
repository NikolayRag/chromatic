base:
	r,g,b - color


	per-spot assignment
	--- or ---
	block center - x/xy/xyz
	block concentrate - 0-1

	block mode - lift/gain


	spring time - time for color to change
	spring bias - make faster at start or at end
	hold - trigger to start changing color



+wake:
	dh,dl,ds - randomize colors at wave pulses
	randomness - per-spot distribution filter

	wave speed - *
	wave smooth - square/sin wave
	wave hit - PWM ratio, simmetrical/spike
	wave jaggy - time distribution randomness
	wave mass - resonance factor
